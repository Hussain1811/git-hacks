1)This is used to move some commits from one development branch to another.

2)Useful while doing hotfixes when we want to cherry pick a commit from the current branch in latest build(with latest changes) to an older branch in the stabi-hotfix build(this also should have all latest changes whatever is there in the current branch). 

Checkout the branch where the cherry picked commits have to come. Do "gitk branch_name" where "branch_name" is the branch from which commits have to be cherry picked => right click on the commit you want to cherry pick => click cherry pick = refresh gitk => you will see the cherry picked stuff now on head => then do git push via gui

3)If you want to cherry pick multiple commits, then always cherry pick from bottom to top that is appearing in the gitk window (similar to picking grapes from a tree). But, with rebasing you don't have to worry about all this as rebase will move these multiple commits in correct sequence.

git cherry-pick -x(for cherry picking) -S(sign off) [commit]
