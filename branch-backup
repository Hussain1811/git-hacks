Say branch is adit_devel_SOPL-7118, take backup of the branch by doing "git checkout -b adit_devel_SOPL-7118_backup".

Then again switch  to ur original branch i.e. "git checkout adit_devel_SOPL-7118"

Do all the experimenting like rebase and all in this original branch

Then do a diff of "backup" and "original branch" using git difftool (ideally, there should be no changes).
