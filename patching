Applying a patch:

"Patch" is nothing but a difference file that is created after doing a change on a file.

	1) Cd /home/sadiqhm/qnx/h08/lta/test/aauto
	2) Vi makefile => do some changes in the makefile
	3) Git status
	4) Git diff > ~/taauto.patch => writing the difference file to ~/taauto.patch
	5) Git apply ~/taauto.patch [OR] git am ~/taauto.patch => this will directly this patch to that
	"particular file" itself.
