Git rebase -I commit_Id_to_be_edited^ => (i)
Give "e" for your commit of interest
Git reset HEAD^ => this will move everything in (i) to unstaged area
Choose the required commits and add to staging area and commit them
Finally, after all adding and commiting is done, then do git rebase --continue
Push the changes to the branch

Alternative:

Give 'e' in the rebase window for the particular commit which u want to split.
The go to git gui, give "amend last commit". 
Through this, you can unstage the already commited changes and commit the particular changes in dedicated commits.
Later give "git rebase --continue".
Then push
